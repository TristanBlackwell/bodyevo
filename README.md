# Bodyevo

## About the project

Body Evo is a small ladies studio/gym with the requirements of a quick, responsive and intuitive website for its customers and clients.

The website required displaying various information regarding the studio, classes and Evo massage.

A payment solution was required for allowing clients to sign up to memberships after agreeing to the relevant T&C's and a contact form in the event of customers having questions to the business.
